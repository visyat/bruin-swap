# BruinSwap

![Banner](./img/banner.png)

BruinSwap is a full-stack web application that allows students to post classes they intend to drop and coordinate class swaps with other students. 

## Installation/Setup

To download and run our application, first clone our git repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/visyat/bruin-swap.git
```

From here, place the required keys into the files `bruin-swap/express-server/.env` and `bruin-swap/client/.env.local`, to properly access our server, PostgreSQL database, and mail framework. 

Once you've done this, you can install dependencies for and run the server and frontend using the shell script we've provided (from within the main `bruin-swap` directory)

```
./setup.sh
```

The backend server will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. If you want to test individual routes, full instructions regarding available routes, request parameters/bodies, and outputs are available in the server README file: `express-server/README.md`. 

The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

If you want to manually install the client and server dependencies, we've outlined the steps below â€” our shell script simply automates this process for convenience.

**NOTE: If you've already run the shell script above, you do not need to run the following commands.**

***

### Server
To install dependencies for our Express.js server, run the following commands: 
```
cd express-server
npm install
```
To run the server, enter the following command:

```
npm start
 ```

### Client
To install dependencies for our frontend application, run the following commands: 
```
cd client
npm i
```

In the `client` directory, place the following in a file named `.env.local` to allow the browser to connect to the server:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URI="http://localhost:3000"
```
To run the completed application, enter the following command: 

```
npm run dev
```

## Main Features 
1. Create posts, proposing class drops, and read & request such listings from other students
2. Filter for course listings that you want, by department, course number, etc.
3. Save courses on your wishlist; when a new post is created offering that course, you will get notified via email
